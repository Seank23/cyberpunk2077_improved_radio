# Improved Radio

Allows full control over the in-game radio. Features include disabling individual songs on each radio station, skipping the current song and creating custom playlists of songs from any station that can be shuffled and saved.

## Features
- Skip Track - Plays a randomly selected song (that is not disabled) on the current radio station. If a playlist is active, it skips to the next song on the playlist (or to a random playlist song if shuffled).
- Track Remover - Allows the playlist of each radio station to be customised by enabling/disabling individual songs on the station.
- Custom Radio Playlists - Allows users to create their own playlists of in-game radio songs, these can be from any radio station in the game. The playlists can be played in the order they were made or in a random order if shuffle is enabled. A playlist can be saved to one of five slots allowing it to be loaded again at a later time.

### Custom Radio Playlist:
- To create a custom playlist, open the 'Custom Radio Playlist' menu and click the 'Add Track' button (6 in image). This will create a new track entry in the playlist tracklist (10 in image), first select the radio station the track belongs to in the 'Select Station' drop-down, then select the track name from the 'Select Track' drop-down.

- Playlists are automatically saved to slots. By default, slot 1 is used. To select a different slot, click the button for the slot you want to select (e.g. 'Slot 2') (9 in image). Now a new playlist can be created which will be saved to this slot. To load a different slot, click a slot button and the playlist saved to that slot will be loaded. The contents of a slot is saved each time a new slot is selected so each playlist can be easily updated.

## Limitations and Issues
- Only works with vehicle radios, the mod does not control radio speakers in the game world.
- Some songs may not be named correctly. If no name is given for a song its event ID is displayed instead.
- Custom playlists can be buggy, they may sometimes repeat a track or skip the next one altogether. If this happens, the 'Skip Track' button can be used to play another track in the playlist.
- Only supports songs already in the game at this time.
